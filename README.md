# mushroom-classification-projct
This project aims to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous using Machine Learning. The mushroom classification data set is used to train and test various ML algorithms such decision tree and random forest. The best model will be deployed as a web application to predict the classification of the of input mushrooms.

# Mushroom classification using machine learning.
this repository contains code for a machine learning model that can classify mushroom as edible or poisonous based on their features the model is based on the mushroom classification data set which contains features as cap shape, cap surface, gill size and stalk colour.
